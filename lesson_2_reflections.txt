How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-The staging area is a part of the working directory that you are prepapring for the commit
-The working directory is just the folder that contains some stuff that may go into the staging area for a commit at some time
-The staging area lets me pick what parts of the working area go into a single commit.
