How did viewing a difference between two version help you spot the bug?
-First time of use of the 'fc' function
-Little experience with diff function
-Could be useful in the future

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
-Easily find mistakes
-Easily revert to older versions
-See when and who made changes/errors

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-Pro:  Good size chunks
-Pro:  Limits unneeded changes/space
-Con:  No safety net

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-Some projects don't have working versions of the entire thing until multiple files change
-Google docs is really focused on version control of a single document for non-coding users

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-Git log lets you view who made changes and when, along with comments
-Git diff lets you see the differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-Knowing it's easy to revert to older revisions frees things up to experiment

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-As version control during CS courses
-As a central repository for data
